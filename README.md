CJenkins
=======

##### How run: 
`python cjenkins "<jenkins address>"`

I recommend to create an alias for cjenkins.

Here is an example:
`alias cjenkins=/<path>/cjenkins.py "<url to jenkins>"`

##### Update:
Now you can add several jenkins' as arguments. That way you can get all your jenkins' in one window!
